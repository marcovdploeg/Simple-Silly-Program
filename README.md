# Simple-Silly-Program

This repository contains a script for a simple program that allows you to click some buttons, give some inputs, and recieve some silly answers.
It uses a GUI implemented using Python's Tkinter module.

Specifically, you can ask the program to pick a number for you, guess which card you have in mind, and how many days remain until your next birtday.
If you complete the process for each button, a secret fourth button may appear...
